### Screenshots
Map view: Our map now centers itself on the user's location instead of a
hardcoded value. The next step for our group in relation to the map, is to make
use of Yelp's API to prepopulate the map with restaurants. There are still some
redundant navigational UI elements visible in this view that we plan to refine.

Chatbot view: This screenshot shows the current state of our chat window. It is
structured in a manner similar to other popular chat applications (Messenger,
Google Hangouts, etc). Currently, the chat functionality is not present, but
this will change once we get Socket.io integrated with our application.
