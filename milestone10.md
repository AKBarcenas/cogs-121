- MapEats is here to simplify the process of finding great local food joints in a natural and
  intuitive manner.
- Today's solutions to online food finding are not very user-centric in their approach; they all
  require the user to have an idea of what they want to eat, and then make the user sift through
  long lists of results. In today's fast-paced society, users need quick, simple, and tailored results!
- Our approach to this user need is natural and user-centric. We use a sophiscated trained bot that
  chats with the user to learn their preferences, and provides human-like responses informing the user
  of the best restaurants catered to their desires.
- **We care.** The foodies of America care. Anyone who appreciates good food, simplicity, and usability care.
  If we're successful, MapEats will revolutionize the way people search for recommendations of any kind.
  We might just help solve hunger in America.
